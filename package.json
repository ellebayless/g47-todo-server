  "description": "The purpose of this is to create a server that will create, read, update and, delete todos. If you want to use `fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile`, you are more than welcome to so your changes to `todos.json` will persist after you restart the server OR you can just require the `todos.json` file. Either way is fine. I HIGHLY recommend you use the [ExpressJS Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html) to help yourself along if you get stuck, too. It is extremely helpful.",
